Open Exhibits - Hurricane Sandy&colon; <em>Before & After</em> Exhibit Template

View the devastation of Hurricane Sandy through satellite pictures taken by NOAA and Google of before and after. The Open Exhibits 2.5 Mask Image Viewer allows a user to explore New Jersey locations by interactively dragging a mask around, as well as resize and rotate it to look at how Hurricane Sandy changed the coastline, destroyed buildings, and flooded streets.

The Collection Viewer places three, large images on stage, and lets users close them, or toss them off stage before replacing them with more images from the pool of 13 satellite photo pairs.

This exhibit includes customizable CML, which contains location information for each of the 13 sets of satellite photographs, and can be edited to have more or less information. The folder contains an .EXE projector and .SWF files ready to be run right away.
